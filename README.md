# World Weather Analysis
## Project Overview:
## Retrieve Weather Data
### Created list of random values for longitude and latitude and then used API to identify which represented valid locations.  Basic weather information was pulled down via API for each city.
## Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
### Used list of cities identified in step above and used Google API to identify destinations and hotels near the selected cities.
## Create a Travel Itinerary Map
### Selected four cities and created a travel itinerary map between the destinations.

After spending a total of 3 hours with a learning assistant via the slack channel I was able to get the heatmaps working.  However, the next time I logged in and ran my code the heatmaps would not appear again.  I tried troubleshooting again but was not able to get the maps to work again.
